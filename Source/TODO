This is a to do file for the system
Need to add in lobby functionality
Need to add a hud

Main menu ->   Host
               Connect
Forget about the menu
For simplicity make the command line args set up wether it is a server or a client
               
client struct 
     needed connection info
     index for the player
     
need a screen design for the lobby

need to decide if moving things around in the various source files makes any sense at all

thoughts about the packets
     so what is needed for the server to send of initialization
     needs to send the initial array of the elements to the clients
     also needs to assign an index for the piece that it controls
     
     operational assumptions, the blocks are indestructible this is needed for the game to function without copious message passing
     needs a host client which will have the same behavior as the connected clients but without the actual connectedness
     
     needs to have the initial setup happen from the command line
     
     so in order for all of the system to function, 
          The clients cannot update until they have recived a message from the server telling them to update their character 
          The clients need to pass a direction and action to the server

     ||Order of events for server|| The server is another thread
     1) host needs to be defined with the number of clients that will be playing
     2) the host will then wait until all of the clients have connected to the system
     3) while the host is waiting for all of the clients to connect it will build the map, with the number of players that it was given at the start of the system
     4) when all of the players have connected they will be transferred a startup_data_packet
          startup_data_packet
          int player_index
          int number_of_elements

     5) The client will then be sent a copy of the map     
     6) This startup packet will need to be turned into the proper struct for the array
     7) once all of the clients send a location, direction, and action the timer will start
     8) The server will be responsible for the timer, it will send out a ping on every time step
     9) It will process the collision detections
